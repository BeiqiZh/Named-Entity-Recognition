# Named Entity Recognition (NER) using LSTMs withÂ Keras
How can we get useful information from massive unstructured documents? This question has been around for a long time before the named entity recognition (NER) model came out. This method can help people to extract key information from many different industries. This article will introduce and explain the methods used to solve the NER problem and shows the coding to build and train a bi-directional LSTM with Keras.
